# Car-Price-Predictor  

## Objective:   
The project's goal is to predict car prices using a Linear Regression model. Key libraries utilized are Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn.

## Data Refinement:   
Data quality was significantly improved through multiple steps, including managing invalid values, filtering non-numeric entries, converting non-numeric columns, handling missing values, and appropriately truncating values when necessary.

## Feature Transformation:   
Categorical attributes were effectively handled using OneHotEncoder, contributing to enhanced learning. A streamlined pipeline was constructed for Linear Regression. Model persistence was ensured through the Pickle library.

## Results and Model Assessment:   
The model's performance was assessed using the R-squared metric, resulting in an achievement of 84.9%. This robust accuracy highlights the model's capability to provide accurate predictions of car prices.
